# oh-my-zsh-vscode-theme

I only tested it on Ubuntu, it will probably work on other Linux distributions. But for Mac OS you will have to set it manually.

---

Make sure oh-my-zsh is installed and the current shell is zsh.

## How do I check?

```
echo $0
```

## Usage:
```
chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```
